## Release planning strategy

We are following AGILE practices, prioritizing user needs and concerns and reaction to changing environment over rigid planning.
We release minor updates to the core platform often, typically once a week.
**Major releases** are driven by introduction of **major features** which deserve additional attention and **dissemination**.

Once it is decided that a **major feature** is the priority, the development of this feature is tracked in **issues**: github, gitlab(s), redmine, etc.
**Issues** blocking this **feature** may receive a correspoding **labels**.

### Feature release: Gallery in MMODA

The coming release is driven by integratng MMODA Gallery in main MMODA UI.
The release is expected for Nov 2023.

As of early Nov 2023, this feature is blocked by insufficient responsiviness of gallery data store.

Integration between MMODA and RenkuLab allows broad range of users to construct MMODA online analysis tools in reproducible jupyterlab environment powered by gitlab, jupyterhub-like platform, and a knowledge graph.
